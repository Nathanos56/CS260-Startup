  "description": "On campus, students put sticky notes in their windows to write messages or draw pictures. My old monitor broke a little while ago so I removed the LCD layer and put it in my window. I am working on setting up a Raspberry Pi that will grab images from Google Drive and display them on the LCD. I will get bored of picking images and I want some help. In this class, I will make a website where people can upload images. I can then approve or veto the images before they get sent to my Google Drive. From there, the Raspberry Pi can grab them.",
