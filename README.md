# CS260-Startup

##elevator pitch
On campus, students put sticky notes in their windows to write messages or draw pictures. A little while ago, my old monitor broke so I took out the lcd layer and put it in my window. I am working on setting up a raspberry pi that will grab images from a google drive and display them on the lcd. I will get bored of picking images and I want some help. In this class I will make a website where people can upload images. I can then approve or veto the images before they get sent to my google drive. From there, the raspberry pi can grab them.

##key features
